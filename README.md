# FlashCard App Frontend

This quiz application has two main features: a quiz mode and an editor mode. The quiz mode allows the user to answer existing public quizzes or self-created quizzes. The editor mode can be used when the user signs-up with an Auth0 account. Within the editor the logged in user can create questions and combine them into a quiz, both offer a range of customization options. The creator decides weather a quiz is accessible to everyone or private in their quiz collection.
